Odin's Recipes | TOP Foundations Project #1
===============================

# Introduction

**TL;DR: The Odin Project, so far, is a fun challenge to getting back into programming, and it's just beginning.**

This is a short and sweet foray into HTML, using skills learned in the first project of the Foundations course, from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) (abbreviated: TOP). **Odin's Recipes** hosts recipes of a few of my favorite food, sourced from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com). This project was made with the following tools / setup:

* **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
* **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code
* **Browser**: Firefox (to view TOP curriculum) and plain 'ol Chrome (to view rendered project)
* **Version Control**: Git / Github, as you can tell
  * **Commit style**: followed closely after [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)


# What I've learned from this, and from TOP (so far)

I'm no stranger to web development. If you look up my profile, you'll see that I've worked on a couple other projects too, some with much more involved tech stacks than a couple of HTML files. Why did I bother going through TOP in the first place, and what did I learn for bothering?

1. **Why**: Because, as it turns out, programming is not like riding a bicycle. Just because I "got it down" once, doesn't mean I can pick it back up after a hiatus and expect to be as proficient as before. I've checked out TOP in the past, but in my misplaced confidence, I believed relearning what I already know to be unnecessary. It is not. Now I am on the bicycle again, and the familiar feeling of learning to ride is nothing short of a blast.

2. **What I learned**: Lots of little, super useful things, actually. TOP *highly* recommends going through its courses using Linux, specifically Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (called Jammy Jellyfish. Apparently, all the Ubuntu versions use cool names like that. Neat!). This was a barrier to learning for me, at first, since I've done everything on Windows since forever. But, I decided to pop an old SSD into my computer, wrangled with installation (I learned the drive was bad hours later), and continued learning from there. The short and long of it is, yes, the Foundations course is all of the basics, which I learned a long time ago. As it turned out, Linux is awesome, Git is much more powerful than I was using it for, and TOP's basics seem to be even *better* than what I thought the basics were.
